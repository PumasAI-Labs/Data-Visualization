This workshop is an introduction to **data visualization** in Julia using `AlgebraOfGraphics`. It covers the following topics:

- `AlgebraOfGraphics` syntax.
- Advanced mapping options.
    - Use visual elements such as coloring and marker style to encode additional variables. 
    - Faceting.
- Geometries and statistical visualizations.
    - Scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, error bars, box plots, and violin plots.
    - Histograms, linear regression, smoothing curves, etc.
- Grammar of graphics: use `*` and `+` to combine and superimpose layers.
- Plot customization. 

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    We recommend users being familiar with Julia syntax, especially variables and types.

    The formal requirements are the [Julia Syntax Workshop](https://pumasai-labs.github.io/Julia-Workshop/)
    and its pre-requisites.
